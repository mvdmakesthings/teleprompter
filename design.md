Typography & Visual Hierarchy
Font sizing: The main heading "Welcome to Teleprompter" appears well-sized, but consider whether the default 24px font size is optimal for teleprompter reading distances
Font choice: Evaluate if the current font family is the most readable for teleprompter use - consider fonts specifically designed for screen reading like Source Sans Pro or Open Sans
Text contrast: Ensure sufficient contrast between white text and the dark background for optimal readability
Control Bar Design
Visual weight: The control bar feels heavy with its dark background - consider a semi-transparent overlay or lighter styling to reduce visual prominence while maintaining functionality
Button grouping: The controls could benefit from logical grouping (playback controls vs. settings vs. voice controls)
Icon consistency: Ensure all icons follow the same visual style and are properly sized for touch targets
Active states: Add clear visual feedback for active/selected states (like the current voice control toggle)
Layout & Spacing
Content centering: The welcome text appears well-centered, but consider the reading area layout for actual teleprompter content
Margins: Evaluate if the side margins are appropriate for reading comfort
Control positioning: Consider whether bottom-mounted controls are the most ergonomic choice
User Experience Enhancements
Visual feedback: The speed indicator (0.30x) could be more prominent or visually integrated
Progress indication: Consider adding a subtle progress indicator for longer scripts
Focus management: Ensure the interface can disappear completely during reading mode
Accessibility: Add keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility
Modern UI Patterns
Material Design influence: Consider adopting more modern button styles with subtle shadows or borders
Micro-interactions: Add smooth transitions for control visibility and state changes
Responsive design: Ensure the interface scales well across different screen sizes
Dark mode optimization: Fine-tune the dark theme for reduced eye strain during extended use
Professional Polish
Loading states: Consider how the interface appears when first launched
Error handling: Plan for graceful error state presentations
Branding: The title treatment could be more sophisticated while maintaining readability
Help integration: Consider subtle onboarding or help integration for first-time users
